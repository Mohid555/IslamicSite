    <h2>Greetings 💌</h2>
    <p>Greetings hold significant importance in Islam, not only as a form of politeness but as a reflection of Islamic values and teachings. Here are some key reasons why greetings are important in Muslim culture:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Spreading Peace:</h3>
            <p>The common greeting "As-Salaam-Alaikum" (Peace be upon you) promotes peace and goodwill among individuals. This greeting aligns with the essence of Islam, which values peace and harmony in society. It's a reminder that Muslims are encouraged to maintain peaceful relations with others.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Brotherhood and Unity:</h3>
            <p>Islam emphasizes the unity of the Muslim community (Ummah). By exchanging greetings, especially with the phrase "Wa-Alaikum-Salaam" (And peace be upon you), Muslims reaffirm their bond of brotherhood and mutual respect. It helps build a sense of belonging and solidarity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>A Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH):</h3>
            <p>Greeting others, particularly with "As-Salaam-Alaikum," is a practice of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). It is highly recommended (Sunnah) to greet one another as a way of following the Prophet's example. The Prophet said:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I tell you about something which, if you do it, will make you love one another? Spread peace (i.e., the greeting of 'As-Salaam') among you." (Sahih Muslim)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This Hadith highlights the importance of greeting to foster love and unity within the community.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>A Form of Dua (Prayer):</h3>
            <p>The greeting "As-Salaam-Alaikum" is not just a formality but a dua (supplication) for the well-being and safety of the person being greeted. It’s a way of wishing others blessings and peace from Allah, making it a spiritually significant act.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Reward and Blessings:</h3>
            <p>Exchanging greetings in Islam is also a way to earn rewards (Hasanat) from Allah. The more complete and sincere the greeting, the greater the reward. A Hadith from the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) states:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"When a man greets his brother with peace and shakes his hand, the sins of both fall like dry leaves from a tree." (Tirmidhi)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Hence, greetings are a way to purify one’s soul and gain spiritual rewards.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Initiating and Maintaining Positive Social Interaction:</h3>
            <p>Greetings in Islam create an atmosphere of warmth and positivity. They encourage people to start conversations with kindness and respect. Islam promotes maintaining good manners and behavior in social interactions, and greetings are the first step towards that.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Inclusiveness and Egalitarianism:</h3>
            <p>The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) encouraged Muslims to greet everyone, whether they know them or not, which fosters inclusivity and respect across all levels of society. It reflects the egalitarian nature of Islamic teachings, emphasizing that all people are equal before Allah.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Respect for Others:</h3>
            <p>In Islam, it is also important to return a greeting when one is given, as the Qur'an says:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"When you are greeted with a greeting, respond with a better greeting or at least return it." (Qur'an 4:86)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This demonstrates respect and acknowledgment of the other person, maintaining mutual respect in interactions.</p>
        </li>
